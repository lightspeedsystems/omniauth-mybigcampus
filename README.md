# OmniAuth for My Big Campus

This gem contains the My Big Campus strategy for OmniAuth.

My Big Campus uses the OAuth 2.0 flow.

## How To Use It

Usage is as per any other OmniAuth 2.0 strategy. If you are using Rails, you need to add the strategy to your `Gemfile`:

    gem 'omniauth-mybigcampus'

You can pull it directly from github via:

    gem 'omniauth-mybigcampus', :git => 'https://github.com/ryanbond/omniauth-mybigcampus.git'

Once these are in, you need to add the following to your `config/initializers/omniauth.rb`:

    Rails.application.config.middleware.use OmniAuth::Builder do
      provider :mybigcampus, "consumer_key", "consumer_secret" 
    end

Now just follow the README at: https://github.com/intridea/omniauth

## Supported Rubies

OmniAuth for My Big Campus is tested under 1.8.7, 1.9.2, 1.9.3 and Ruby Enterprise Edition.

## Note on Patches/Pull Requests

- Fork the project.
- Make your feature addition or bug fix.
- Add tests for it. This is important so I donâ€™t break it in a future version unintentionally.
- Commit, do not mess with rakefile, version, or history. (if you want to have your own version, that is fine but bump version in a commit by itself I can ignore when I pull)
- Send me a pull request. Bonus points for topic branches.
